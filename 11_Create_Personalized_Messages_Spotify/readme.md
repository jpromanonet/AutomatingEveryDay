This program uses the Spotipy library to access the Spotify Web API and retrieve the tracks of a specific playlist. Then, it loops through each track and sends a personalized message to the listener who added the track to the playlist. You can customize the message_template variable to fit your message and the send_email() or send_sms() functions to send the message through your preferred messaging service.
